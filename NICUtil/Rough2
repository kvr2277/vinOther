All you do is check entire code in:
https://github.com/kvr2277/vinxplore/tree/master/NICUtil/src/main/java/com/vinJersey

This is the client class - which calls the Restful service
https://github.com/kvr2277/vinxplore/blob/master/NICUtil/src/main/java/com/vinJersey/client/JerseyClientGet.java

This is the service class
https://github.com/kvr2277/vinxplore/blob/master/NICUtil/src/main/java/com/vinJersey/rest/JSONService.java

In client u call :
http://localhost:9280/NICUtil/rest/contact/get

Question - How that path comes? 
Answer - NICUtil is my application name 
and 
Check web.xml
https://github.com/kvr2277/vinxplore/blob/master/NICUtil/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml

<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>jersey-serlvet</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>/rest/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

and in service class - JSONService.java
@Path("contact")
@Path("/get")


Your problem:
1. Call one rest service (A)
2. From A call one more rest service (B)
3. Get JSON (J) from B
4. But B is not available, so you want to mock B with the json u have

You need to do:
1. Either prepare a client using 
JerseyClientGet.java
or JerseyClientPost.java
2. Call a service similar to JSONService.java (lets call this A)
3. Now JSONService.java is your new intermediate client which has to call B
4. In JSONService's method
	public Business getTrackInJSON() {
		//write some commented code to call B
		//and get the response from B
		//return the JSON (you replace your sample JSON here and uncomment)
	}
